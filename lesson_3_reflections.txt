When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is practical for editing when on the move or for collaborative work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So I can decide what version of my projects to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are specific to Github only, it allow us to get a copy of a repository and to work on it.
Clones is practical for making copies of repositories locally and on Github.
Branches allow to save various version locally and on Github. It can be shared with other people that may work on various versions without compromising Master version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can be sure to work on latest version of repositary and avoid work on an updated version

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Collaborators meeting might be an alternative but I think Git and Github are so efficient and practical that I cannot think of another option.
